The Impact of Patient Readmission to Healthcare Systems (2020)

**Introduction**

During my last year of university (2020), I took a business analytics course as an elective recommended by my friend. That course introduced me to the world of analytics and ignited my passion for using data to make an impact. 

This course had a group white paper project that could be on any topic as long as it is feasible. My colleagues and I decided on a whitepaper discussing “The Impact of Patient Readmission to Healthcare Systems.” I led our efforts on creating a model utilizing R that predicts which patients are more likely to be readmitted to the hospital given certain factors. This project allowed me to explore the various analytical techniques and how it can be used to drive business decisions.

With the knowledge I’ve learned from my Master's program and work experience, I would like to redo this project to see how much I have learned and grown.
